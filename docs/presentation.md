# Journalist’s Creed

I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust 

I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.  

I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.

# Feedback Loops

![Image](/assets/cause_effect.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- **Clear:** Obvious solutions, possibly with a single agreed upon best-practice documented in a rulebook.
- **Complicated:** Known solutions that may cross domains of expertise or where cause-and-effect is difficult to track. May require the analysis and integration of multiple rulebooks.
- **Complex:** Lacks broadly applicable best practices or recipes. The system may involve novel elements and cause/effect are only indirectly related.
- **Chaotic:** A dynamically changing complex system that may reject previously viable solutions.

# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- **Simple:** Baking a cake with a recipe from a cookbook.
- **Complicated:** Cooking a full four-course meal for your family who expect to eat at 7:00 p.m.
- **Complex:** Cooking for 100 people arriving throughout the evening who are allowed special off-menu requests that may include dishes you may lack ingredients for.
- **Chaotic:** Cooking meals for the same 100 people who are also allowed to change their order at anytime during the process and where the gas and electricity frequently turn off at unexpected times.


---

<!-- _class: gold-bullets -->
# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- It is the nature of emergent problems to be complicated or complex
- The lack of visible connection between cause and effect (no feedback loop) diminishes our ability to learn and improve the process.
- Complex problems can become ‘complicated’ or even ‘simple’ over time as solutions and best practices are identified and tested
- Chaotic environments may not necessarily be improved through effort/learning. Re-defining the scope of the problem may be the better solution.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# For example

It is the first day of school, you are living in a new apartment off-campus, and you need to get to class on time.

- Is this problem simple, complicated, complex or chaotic?
- What are the elements of the problem?
- Which elements can we control / manage?
- How do we go about simplifying it?
- How do we solve for it?


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Problem Solving

Analyze the problem

- Do I have a car?
- Where do I park?
- How far from campus?
- Does my complex have a bus?
- When does it run?
- Is it normally dependable?
- Even on the first day of school?

# A broken fan

- You are staying for a few days in a friend’s apartment in a brand new building
- Your friend is out and you have turned on the fan to cool the room
- Ten minutes later the fan turns off - you turn it back on
- Five minutes later it turns off again - and so on, several times

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Problem Domains

- User Error
- Mechanical failure
- Power supply
- Accidental cause
- Other actor
- External systems


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The root cause

- The building is new
- Every apartment has the same brand / model ceiling fan
- They have a remote control
- Each remote carries one of eight different ID codes to connect to a specific fan
- The remotes in this building can reach 16 different apartments


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Five Whys

- ISSUE: The fan keeps turning off
- Why: The remote controls reach other apartments
- Why: The RF strength is too high
- (And) Why: The remotes have overlapping ID codes
- (And) Why: Only eight codes are programmed
- Why: The design of the fans assumed single-family homes, not apartments
- (Also) Why: The developer of the apartments did not read the fine print

# The invention of consumerism

- Industrialization of the U.S. reduced costs and increased volume
- Railroads drove mass distribution
- Mass distribution increased competition
- Competition incentivized diversification
- Diversification required marketing and promotion to differentiate


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The business of business

- Diversification and distribution required specialization
- Managing specialization and scale led to organizational restructuring
- Restructuring required re-allocation of previously shared functions
- Functional - One Design department across brands
- Divisional - Each brand with its own Design team
- Matrix - Each brand has dedicated Designers from a centralized team


---

# Control vs Agility

![Image](/assets/control_agility.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# What works best?

WHY do many businesses land on a Hybrid model?

- **Centralization and Control** work best in stable, mature markets
- And, in businesses with a single product and market
- **Decentralization and Agility** are better suited to new and chaotic markets
- Or, in businesses with diversified products and markets


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Hybrid

- Some functions (Accounting) should not be innovating
- Other functions (Human Resources) may be centralized with some minimal risk
- Depending on the core consumer value of the business - functions that differentiate (Design, Marketing) might be best de-centralized/kept very local.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Why an audience focus?

Why does decentralization / optimization often win?

- In a competitive environment - products must differentiate
- Quickest way is to understand and serve consumer needs
- Business must allow workers closest to customers (who have empathy / understanding of needs) to drive change
- Organizational Structure must balance decentralization and efficiency

# Start by discovering consumer needs

People are complicated and multitasking. They don’t always recognize or can’t always explain needs and possible solutions.


- We need to understand how people think and why
- We must use appropriate research methods
- Then, synthesize the data and develop insights


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Discovering consumer needs

- Our brains don’t work the way we think they do

# Bounded rationality (page 31)

- We do NOT make decisions based on perfect information, focused attention and flawless judgement. *(Optimizing)*
- Traditional economic theory assumes we do.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Bounded rationality

- Our decisions are made with limited information, are based heavily on past experiences and are made in a rush. We try to balance the effort of the decision against the costs and benefits of the choice. *(Satisficing)*
- We call this reliance on patterns a heuristic - or an informed guess.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# Don’t make me think

- Satisficing vs Optimizing
- Our brains have limited processing power
- Working (transient) memory is required to learn new things
- If overloaded, frustration and task failure results
- Solutions must minimize load

> "To fix the creaking at the Post, Lewis invokes a couple of tropes from 2012 and 2024, respectively: The company will achieve “scale” by “embracing AI in a much more effective way.” Fair—but almost everyone in the news business is going after some combination of scale and AI (some by letting robots flat-out make stuff up), and odds are it will work for very few. Maybe the Post will be one. I’m rooting for them. But what about the journalism that all of us need to keep democracy alive? What is—to use a word smart men love to toss out—the gamechanger for the news business?”

**Day One**
Researcher stood inside the restaurant and took an inventory of all milkshake-buying customers. This is a very simple ethnographic-like study.

- 40% of shakes were sold between 6a - 8a.
- Most purchasers arrived alone
- Bought only a shake
- Left with their drink

# Understanding consumers

**Day Two Questions**

Why did you buy a milkshake?
**I was hungry.**
Where are you going?
**Driving to work.**
Do you come to this restaurant often?
**Sometimes.**

**Better Day Two Questions**

Did you buy a milkshake yesterday?
**No**
What did you buy?
**A bagel; a doughnut; a banana…**
Today, why did you buy a milkshake instead?

# Understanding Jobs to Be Done

On days they did not buy a milkshake, they were filling the same need with other products. (Other foods in this case.)

The consumers were HIRING the milkshake for a specific job.

If we understand the job, we understand their needs and motivations better.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Understanding Jobs to Be Done

**The job in this case:**

These were commuters with a 20 - 30 minute drive to work

They were bored but also hungry
- A banana is eaten too quickly
- It is difficult to put cream cheese on a bagel while driving
- The doughnut is not filling 

The milkshake takes 20 minutes to drink, can be done with one hand and keeps them full until lunch.

# Innovation is received as:

- Determinism - the idea that **technology shapes society and drives social change**, rather than the other way around. It assumes that once a technology exists, its development and effects are **inevitable** and largely **out of human control.**
- Social Constructivism - Technology does not determine society; instead, society determines how technology develops and is used. **Different social groups** (engineers, users, regulators, companies) can **have different interpretations** of what a technology is for. Technologies evolve to satisfy social, cultural, economic, or political needs, not just technical ones.

# Innovation is studied:

- **Science and Technology Studies** - How science, technology, and society shape each other
- **Social Construction of Technology** - Technologies evolve based on the needs, interpretations, and struggles of different social groups.

- *Manufacturers*: Catered to upper-class market; expensive to produce, profitable as luxury goods.

> “On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it’s so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So, you have these two fighting against each other.”

The superintendent of the schools isn’t sure how he will tell the community what’s happening inside its classrooms. The head of the local food pantry is in mourning; he turned to the paper when his organization was about to be kicked out of its building.
The three city leaders are distressed. That said, none of them was subscribing to the paper when it published its last issue.”

# Community Doesn’t Scale

- Programmatic advertising needs scale
- Local journalism has specific geographic constraints
- Chasing a scaled business model but a local editorial mission is a fundamental conflict
- Local journalism requires a local community engaged at all levels


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# The Consequences of Scale

- Average page-load times are far too high
- Ad takeovers and abusive redirects drive daily complaints
- Click-bait, attention-gap headlines, promoted links…
- Opportunity cost spent on platform plays
- Pushing out-of-state stories over social to go viral
- A focus on page views as the key metric

# Change in Digital News

- Culture, tech and embedded processes make change difficult in legacy organizations
- But the disruption of audience and business models require it
- We must focus our concerns on audience needs
- But we must also change our organizations
- Both require intangible changes - and also new goals, tools & incentives

# Final Paper Outline: Five Paragraphs - Due: March 6 

**INTRODUCTION**
 What is it you believe about the Future of News and the specific focus/topic you are researching? **State the Thesis**: the main idea + supporting details.
**PARAGRAPH TWO**
What is the current context of your idea/topic/focus in the business and practice of news?  Provide a few sentences about how it is being used, practiced, and discussed, OR where is it being used/seen if not in news already?


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Final Paper Outline: Five Paragraphs - Due: March 6 

**PARAGRAPH THREE**
 Whether you believe your topic/focus is or isn't the 'future' of news, provide a few sentences discussing the benefits, risks, incentives or constraints of the idea. What makes it practical, impractical, beneficial, or harmful to news. Include examples of the risks/benefits when possible.  
**PARAGRAPH FOUR**
A few final sentences about where this idea is headed within news - what is the current trajectory and what do you think it should be?
**CONCLUSION**
Summarize your main points - restate the thesis and connect it with the body of the essay.  (You may need to rework/revise your paragraphs at this point to make the conclusion coherent. That is the objective.)

# Digital Changes Things

- Information abundance (and attention scarcity)
- End of gatekeeping (and of those institutions)
- Global connectivity but local fragmentation
- A shift of power to platforms (and centralization of power and profit)
- The acceleration of change (move fast, break things)
- Datafication of society
- --Loss of Privacy


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Digital Changes Things

Journalism needs to adapt - but maintain its focus on mission and community

- Develop capacity for digital strategy
- Integrate technology and technologists
- Recognize the competitive threat of *everything else* online
- Find and engage audiences - with news not distraction
- We broadly call these methods: news product thinking


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Finding a Product-Market Fit

Aligning a product or service with the needs of a clearly defined group. It is demonstrated when consumers:


- Adopt it
- Have a high retention rate
- Use it regularly
- Recommend it to others


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# Finding a Product-Market Fit

New restaurant in town: One Thing

**Who is this restaurant serving?**


- No menu - flat-rate price.
- It serves one different meal daily for lunch
- Each meal is $10 - cash only
- Located near campus

![Image](/assets/one_thing.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Finding a Product-Market Fit

A constraint (one dish or one price) is a design choice. The questions are:

- Was the choice intentional or unintentional? (how do we know?)
- What group / audience will find it relevant/useful? (how do we know?)
- Is it working? (how do we know?)
- To succeed or grow, what must we do next? (how do we know?)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Who is news designed for?

- Does everyone care about CoMo news? (geography)
- Can everyone afford a subscription? (price)
- Do we cover everyone in our reporting? (menu)
- Does everyone have broadband (accessibility)
- What operational trade-offs have we made? (sustainability)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Desgning the news

Implicitly, we have NEVER been equally serving 'everyone' but the industrial model and profitability obscured that reality. We must now approach the discussion with more intentionality and scientific rigor. Not all of our constraints are weaknesses - some are by design. But which are which?

- Limited geography
- Limited coverage topics
- Cost of access
- Relevance / perceived value
- Bias / gaps
- The demands of organizational structure and profits


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Innovating the News

- Discussing this chapter Week 7 & 8
- Journalism has a long history of embracing innovation
- And, it has also been slow to adapt to the digital age
- We must develop community-focused solutions’
- Newsrooms are, unevenly, becoming more digital

<!-- _class: template-quote -->
> Innovation is:
The creation of new social or economic value


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# But really also…

- An idea new to us
- A process improvement that boosts value
- A new business model
- An old product brought to a new market
- A novel combination of the above

# Separate, but necessary?

Digital editors like Roberts “were just as powerful as their counterparts running the print newspaper.… They decided what stories should go on the homepage and how long they should stay there.” 

That couldn’t last forever. As the site’s business side moved from an advertiser- to a subscriber-first model, a merger would become critical. 

And, as Schiller notes, “trust began to build over time. It was, in hindsight, the only way it could have gone.

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# Separate, but necessary?

Many internal start-up efforts (or other innovation initiatives) are placed outside the view and control of legacy organization and managers.

# Innovation must be nurtured

Organizational culture reacts to innovation like an immune system to a virus. Innovation must overcome or avoid: 

- Politics
- Structure
- Power grabs
- Resource constraints
- A sense of complacency

# Lessons for Innovation

- Digital has changed the mechanics of innovation
- VC-mandated growth is not the same as product-market-fit
- Press releases are not the same as success
- Consumer needs / preferences will usually prevail
- But negative externalities can still be embedded *(privacy, misinformation, electric rates)*
- These patterns always repeat but may take a decade to be universally recognized.”


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# For News: Why ‘Second Life’?

- Is VR (now the Metaverse) a site for journalism?
- Should we be experimenting there?
- Was Reuters right to try
- What makes them the right / wrong newsroom to test?
- What were the risks to Reuters?
- How would those risks apply to other newsrooms?

# Lessons for Innovation

- Coroprate ownership has a limited attention span
- -And a limited appetite for even successful small ventures
- NBCUniversal earned $28.5 billon in 2015
- Comcast (it's parent) earned $74.5 bllion.
- A corporate $5 million business with no executive champion is a roundng error
- A privatately-owned $5 million business is a success story


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Lessons for Innovation

- Building something new requires space and time
- We often shorthand this as 'culture'
- But it is also: having a good idea, persistence and timing
- It requires: Understanding your business your audience
- Understanding comes through research

# Questions for newsrooms

Why do more newsrooms not consider aggregation a service?

- Factal aggregates and adds value to news reports
- Facebook, Reddit, TikTok etc are all aggregators
- Apple Music, Spotify, Netflix are aggregators
- Newspapers were aggregators: News, Sports, Comics, Games, Classifieds

- Why does aggregation provide value?

# What I believe

- Journalism is the practice of knowledge creation
- The internet has been developed for profitable distraction (aka cute cat TikToks)
- Big tech is not (always) our enemy but it is (almost) never our friend
- Technology changes how we work and magnifies the consequences of our actions
- **This is a fundamental risk for journalistic ethics, values, mission and trust**

# Big Tech is Scale

- Platforms commodify a global audience

# Warning signs of un-managed risk

- Tech is an intermediary between publisher and reader
- It is deeply integrated into business / editorial systems
- Switching costs are high, and options limited
- Consequences are abstract, or remain long dormant
- And, Values and Ethical questions go unasked

# 3. Why is Digital Different?

- In the ‘industrial era’ we owned the tools
- Our institutions, roles and process evolved with the ‘tech’
- Values, ethical codes, professional norms protected the mission
- The business had vertical integration: from trees to doorstep
- Departments operated independently and asynchronously
- The competitive environment was stable and favorable


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Platforms now own the tools

News organizations have a weak professional culture of:


- *Technical skills* (how does this technology work?)
- *Systems thinking* (how does it integrate?)
- *Innovation* (how can it create value?)
- *Strategic patience* (how long to see the benefits?)

- How does it work?
- Who built it?
- Who is profiting from it?
- Why, how and where should we use it?

# Telling the story

- Highly contextual and relevant to local culture and conditionsEwd2@855
- Clearly explained chain of (potential) effects
- Tangible discussion of harms - quality, trust, revenue, reputation
- Supported by research, case studies, expert opinions
- Offered with solutions, alternatives, mitigations

# How to help your organization be smarter about tech

- Understand ((intuition is the default**, and rationality takes effort
- Recognize that change is difficult and **‘facts’ are not enough**

- Translate tech complexity for **better mental models**
- Discuss and **build on examples** tied to current experience
- And remember Journalism is **built on trust**

Mission: To guide the community’s deliberation of public issues, motivating people to get involved in the process and advocating for solutions.

Strategy: Create participatory opportunities—events, surveys, and digital tools—that invite community input and feedback on pressing public issues.

- Host community forums or listening sessions on specific local issues
- Partner with libraries, schools, or civic groups to co-sponsor events that combine reporting and dialogue.
- Facilitate “citizens’ panels” or public idea labs, where residents deliberate on proposed solutions and journalists cover the discussion.

# Strategies

- Transparency and Accountability in the Newsroom
- Collaborations & Partnerships
- Audience-Centric Distribution
- Community Engagement & Participatory Journalism
- Civic Education and Contextual Reporting
- Data-Driven and Investigative Reporting
- Solutions Journalism


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Transparency and Accountability in the Newsroom

**Goal**: Model the deliberative process internally.
**Strategy**: Implement a transparent and accountable newsroom practice that openly shares editorial decision-making, challenges, and priorities — demonstrating the values of deliberation, integrity, and responsiveness to the public.
**Tactics:**
	•	Explain editorial decisions, sourcing, and methods to readers.
	•	Publish corrections openly and discuss reporting challenges.
	•	Share newsroom priorities and invite public feedback on coverage gaps.
**Impact**: Builds trust and encourages a culture of open deliberation.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Collaborations & Partnerships

**Goal**: Leverage expertise and amplify reach.
**Strategy**: Establish a collaborative journalism network that taps into external expertise and shared resources — combining the newsroom’s storytelling strengths with partners’ research, data, and community connections to expand both depth and audience impact.
**Tactics**:
	•	Partner with universities, think tanks, or nonprofits for research-based reporting.
	•	Collaborate with other media outlets on joint investigative projects.
	•	Work with local civic organizations to co-host events or surveys.
**Impact**: Strengthens credibility, expands reporting capacity, and deepens community connections.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Audience-Centric Distribution

**Goal**: Ensure reporting reaches and resonates with the right people.
**Strategy**: Adopt an audience-centered distribution strategy that tailors content delivery and messaging to meet readers where they are — using segmentation, analytics, and timely communication to maximize engagement and civic impact.
**Tactics**:
	•	Segment newsletters by topic and neighborhood to target relevant readers.
	•	Use push notifications for breaking issues that need immediate public attention.
	•	Analyze engagement metrics to understand which stories drive civic action.
**Impact**: Increases participation by making journalism actionable and accessible.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Community Engagement & Participatory Journalism

**Goal**: Make the newsroom a facilitator of public conversation.
**Strategy**: Build a community engagement framework that positions the newsroom as a trusted civic convener — creating structured spaces for dialogue, listening, and collaborative storytelling between journalists and the public.
**Tactics**:
	•	Host town halls, panel discussions, and online forums around key local issues.
	•	Encourage reader submissions (questions, letters, story ideas) and publish community voices.
	•	Launch social media campaigns to crowdsource opinions or highlight public debates.
**Impact**: Creates a two-way dialogue between journalists and citizens, increasing civic involvement.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Civic Education and Contextual Reporting

**Goal**: Help readers understand how government and policies work.
**Strategy**: Create a civic literacy and explanatory journalism initiative that demystifies public institutions and processes — giving readers the context, tools, and confidence to navigate and influence local decision-making.
**Tactics**:
	•	Publish explainer series on local government structures, budgeting, and elections.
	•	Offer guides on how readers can participate in public meetings, boards, or policy consultations.
	•	Highlight the consequences of policy decisions in accessible, relatable ways.
**Impact**: Reduces barriers to participation and makes civic engagement more actionable.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Data-Driven and Investigative Reporting

**Goal**: Inform public debate with credible, verifiable evidence.
**Strategy**: Develop a data-driven, investigative reporting model that grounds civic discussion in facts — using evidence, analysis, and transparency to clarify complex public issues.
**Tactics**:
	•	Invest in data journalists to analyze trends in education, public safety, transportation, etc.
	•	Visualize complex data with charts, interactive maps, and dashboards.
	•	Publish investigative reports that expose inefficiencies or inequities in local systems.
**Impact**: Builds trust, provides common factual ground for deliberation, and motivates informed civic participation.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Solutions Journalism

**Goal**: Move beyond reporting problems to exploring potential solutions.
**Strategy**: Adopt a solutions journalism framework that focuses coverage on how people and institutions respond to community challenges — what’s working, what’s not, and why.
**Tactics**:
        •	Dedicate reporters to cover policy experiments, community programs, and innovative local initiatives.
	•	Produce follow-up stories on the outcomes of public projects.
	•	Highlight expert analysis and case studies that offer actionable insights for readers.
**Impact**: Encourages readers to engage with issues, understand trade-offs, and see paths forward.

---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Analogous interviews

When presented with a challenge in one business or industry - a helpful perspective can come from understanding similar issues and solutions in other domains.


- A project to improve personalization on a news website :: may be similar to recommendation efforts at Netflix or Spotify
- Can you talk to people in those other industries, or read past coverage of those projects.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Ethnography

- The direct observation of subjects in their natural environment
- The Internet-connected toothbrush is a good candidate for this method:
- --What are people’s routines?
- --How would this new product fit?
- --Where would it be placed? Is there space or electrical outlets?
- We will review another specific example of this tomorrow


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# In-depth interviews

- Typically in-person conversations (but remote can work)
- Often 45 - 60 minutes
- Researcher utilizes a semi-structured interview script
- Discussion is designed to encourage reflection of topic
- Similar to a user survey (we will discuss next) but interactive
- Allow for follow-up questions and digging for the ‘why’ behind answers


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Customer Surveys

- Questions sent to potential customers
- Typically online/digital
- Must be carefully designed to generate useful data
- Start with broad questions and work toward specifics
- The more questions or the harder the questions, the fewer people will participate
- We will talk much more about surveys tomorrow

# Critical Thinking

![Image](/assets/critical_thinking.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Critical Thinking

- **Know**: Recognize and be able to speak about the concepts
- **Understand**: Able to summarize and put the ideas into your own words
- **Apply**: Use the ideas in practice on a new problem or in a different domain
- **Analyze**: Recognize patterns or trends and discuss component parts
- **Integrate**: Use knowledge from other sources and fields
- **Evaluate**: Weigh strengths and weaknesses and suggest changes


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# A broken fan

- You are staying for a few days in a friend’s apartment in a brand new building
- Your friend is out and you have turned on the fan to cool the room
- Ten minutes later the fan turns off - you turn it back on
- Five minutes later it turns off again - and so on, several times


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Problem Domains


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The root cause

- The building is new
- Every apartment has the same brand / model ceiling fan
- They have a remote control
- Each remote carries one of eight different ID codes to connect to a specific fan
- The remotes in this building can reach 16 different apartments


---

<!-- _class: template-full-photo-headline -->
# Fve Whys


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Five Whys

- **ISSUE**: The fan keeps turning off**
- **Why**: The remote controls reach other apartments
- **Why: The RF strength is too high
- **(And) Why**: The remotes have overlapping ID codes
- **(And) Why**: Only eight codes are programmed
- **Why:** The design of the fans assumed single-family homes, not apartments
- **(Also) Why**: The developer of the apartments did not read the fine print

# Paper Prototypes


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Prototyping

**Horizontal** - The prototype reflects the full set of pages / sections / features but each may include minimal interactivity or depth of detail.
This allows us to explain the product to users, ask questions about navigation, organization, expectations and overall value / interest.

**Vertical** - The prototype reflects a sub-set of set of pages / sections / features but one or more include interactivity and detail, possibly including an initial visual design.
This allows us to test specific scenarios of use, user interface, usability and individual functions.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Prototyping

Prototyping is frequently used for physical or digital objects
But, it can also be applied to ideas, processes and services

- A guided talk-it-through approach
- Storyboards of the user journey
- Role playing
- Live walk-through

# Three types of research

- Academic
- Audience
- Business


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Academic Research

- **Normative**- what should things be
- **Descriptive**-  how are things actually
- **Analytical**-  why does that happen
- **Prescriptive**- how can we close the gap


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Academic Research

Also: Qualitative vs Quantitative

- Quantitative
- --Surveys
- --Analytics
- --Sales reports
- Qualitative
- --Interviews
- --Focus Groups
- --Customer call verbatims


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Qualitative vs Quantitative Research

- Quantitative data tells us ‘what’ not why’
- Averages hide realities
- But - surveys are cheap!
- We can only understand by talking directly with consumers
- It is still cost-effective and avoids building the wrong thing for the wrong reason


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Business research

- How do we run the business
- Make a profit
- Sometimes: and improve society


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Business research

- **Strategic** - structure, competition, and long-term direction.
- **Market**- customers, competitors, and market conditions
- **Product **- evaluating and improving specific offerings
- **Usability** - testing the functionality of a service / product
- **Pricing** - testing demand and willingness to pay
- **Advertising **- optimizing promotion and messaging
- **Communications / Brand** - reputation tracking, crisis management


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Designing Surveys

- What is the primary objective (root cause/goal) of your survey?
- Who needs to be surveyed?
- What are the key questions to answer?
- Are there better methods than a survey for any of these questions?
- Can we follow up the survey with limited in-depth interviews?


---

<!-- _class: bullets-image-split -->
# Designing for Surveys

- Assume no respondent will take more than 5 minutes
- Write simple questions - avoid any ambiguity
- Ask one thing per question
- Turn complex thoughts into multiple questions
- Support recognition not recall
- Group questions to build understanding
- Don’t lead (bias) the witness
- Use standard survey language when possible

![Image](/assets/survey_demos.png)


---

<!-- _class: bullets-image-top -->
# Designing for Surveys

- Yes / No
- Multiple Choice
- Likert Scale (Rank 1-7)
- Short answer


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Designing for Surveys

The quality of questions dictates the quality of answers

- A survey must have ONE specific goal
- Each question must be:
- -Relevant and clear to the respondent
- -Competently answerable
- -Provide cognitive support

# Market Failure

In economics, a market failure occurs when the free market 
fails to produce or sustain a socially desirable good at the level society needs 

*There is still value*
**There is not revenue**


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The Economics of News

We can try to: (*week nine)


- Grow audience (and grow overall revenue)
- Increase ARPU
- Extract subsides elsewhere (ads, services, events)
- Diversify other resvenue sources


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The Economics of News

It is COMPLICATED:

*Print* is **Inelastic**
*Digital* is **Elastic**

- Elastic - consumers are highly responsive to changes in price. A small cost increase causes a large decrease in the quantity demanded. (Raise the price - lose subscribers)
- Inelastic -  a price increase causes little or no change in quantity demanded.

# Prioritization

Prioritization is the allocation of scarce resources 
to achieve the best outcomes


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Chaotic Systems

- The first mistake in planning is to underestimate the complexity
- The second mistake is to think ‘final’ decisions are ‘final’
- Third mistake is to not consider constraints
- Most prioritization problems are chaotic, undefinable and unpredictable


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# In Business

- Resources are limited
- Time to make decisions is limited
- Cause/effect of decisions are unclear
- Long-term plans must be flexible
- We can’t simplify the problem
- But we can use tools to manage the decision

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# How do you prioritize?

- You have three finals and two major projects due the last week of classes.
- There are four weeks remaining
- How do you decide which to work on first?


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# What if?

- You need a book only available via loan?
- Your current grade in one of the classes is C+?
- One of the projects is group work?
- The project group can only meet Saturday mornings?

> You can’t prioritize without first understanding 
your mission, strategy and goals

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# What are your desired outcomes?

- Learning
- A+ in each class
- Maintaining a target GPA
- A in two classes, above a C in another
- Graduation

# Software development

Software projects throw those variables into sharp relief

- Require careful advance planning
- Outcomes must be aligned with needs and goals
- Resources / capacity is limited
- Prioritization is therefore challenging
- Costs are also relatively high

# Waterfall development

- **Requirements** – define everything up front
- **Design** – plan the full system
- **Implementation** – write the code
- **Testing** – verify it works

# Agile Manifesto

*We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:*


- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

# Division of Labor & Coordination (chapter 3)

- **Mutual adjustment** is an informal collaboration possible only when a team is small enough to easily share and understand the precise details of each other’s work.
- **Direct supervision** is the first step in the division of labor and may include a manager who shares in and oversees the work.
- **Job descriptions** further clarify the distinctions between employee roles and responsibilities, including guidance on tasks and processes.
- **Detailed specifications** standardize and dictate relevant elements of the work, including the required qualities of a finished product.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Henry Mintzberg (chapter 3)

- Ms. Raku and Mrs. Bisque - Pottery Shop
- As the team grows - employee tasks become narrower
- Formalization of job descriptions and task documentation
- In the extreme model - an assembly line - no mutual coordination is expected
- Strict specifications, inputs and outputs are required


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Waterfall development

- An industrial-age method
- Development is done in strict handoffs between phases
- Research to Design to Planning to Manufacturing
- Makes sense for very large / complicated but mature products
- Documentation is done months or years in advance
- Factories are built, and design remains mostly unchanged for years
- Automobiles, computer chips, washing machines, airplanes

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# What are the risks here?

- Requires layers of management
- Distances decisions from customers
- Neglects the knowledge / insight of staff
- Imposes long chains of decision-making
- **Slow, inflexible, expensive**


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# How is digital different?

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# How is digital different?

- Consumer has more power
- Little / no capital investment in single-purpose ‘factories’
- Design / development cycles are shorter
- Build - Measure - Learn
- Knowledge management can devolve power
- Able to respond to market changes / opportunities
- Can launch - then iterate
- **But, there is an excess of information to manage / share / coordinate**


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Coordination of work

*Enabling mutual coordination in large organizations - even if it is more asynchronous than in smaller teams*

**Most digital-native project management is:**


- Ensuring the right information is shared
- Roles / responsibilities are understood
- Deadlines are communicated
- There is agreement on the problem being solved


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# How is digital disruptive to the business of news?

- Shifts power in the attention economy to the audience
- Shifts power in the market to aggregators (collecting eyeballs & ads)
- Eliminates the protection of geographic monopolies
- Destabilizes organizational structures through access to information (metrics, etc)
- Eliminates support roles (i.e. copyeditors) and accelerates publishing cadence
- Reduces barriers to entry by competitors
- Requires constant readjustment to new technologies and challenges

# Rational resistance

When irrational resistance occurs, people likely ever going to agree to change - that is a harder discussion.

- The vision for change has not been fully communicated.
- The vision has been shared, but not persuasively.
- The plan itself has irreconcilable flaws.
- The systems and processes to implement the plan are insufficient.

- **Time scale**—Is it a short-term or long-term effort?
- **Resources**—Is the investment fixed and defined or still undefined?
- **Objectives**—Is the goal tactical and objective or visionary and subjective?
- **Perceptions**—Is there an agreement that this change is necessary?
- **Interest**—Is the project and its group of stakeholders well-defined, or not?
- **Control**—Does the group proposing the change have the authority to enact it?
- **Source**—Is the catalyst for change internally developed or externally imposed?
