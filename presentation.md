# Final Paper Outline: Five Paragraphs - Due: March 6 

**PARAGRAPH THREE**
 Whether you believe your topic/focus is or isn't the 'future' of news, provide a few sentences discussing the benefits, risks, incentives or constraints of the idea. What makes it practical, impractical, beneficial, or harmful to news. Include examples of the risks/benefits when possible.  
**PARAGRAPH FOUR**
A few final sentences about where this idea is headed within news - what is the current trajectory and what do you think it should be?
**CONCLUSION**

<!-- _class: gold-quote -->
> “BIDDEFORD, Maine—The mayor worries for his city because the local newspaper, the Journal Tribune, ended its 135-year run Saturday. The superintendent of the schools isn’t sure how he will tell the community what’s happening inside its classrooms. The head of the local food pantry is in mourning; he turned to the paper when his organization was about to be kicked out of its building.
The three city leaders are distressed. That said, none of them was subscribing to the paper when it published its last issue.”

# Sustaining local news

- Profit is generated by creating and capturing excess value
- I create a new widget for $1
- Consumers find that widget to be worth $2
- If I can distribute product and collect the $2 - I profit $1

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# But news is not a widget

- Identify current / likely competition for those services.
- Calculate the cost of staff, technology, and capital investments.
- Deliver a “public good” value to the community.
- ***Where do I capture the excess value / subsidies?***

> Why did it fail?


---

<!-- _class: gold-bullets -->
# Why did text on your TV fail?

- Expensive ($900 / $12 a month)
- Limited information
- One-way communication
- Not social
- The Internet was a better solution
- ***The innovation was ‘too early’ and lacking parts of the solution***


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Why else did text on TV fail?

- News media are not dominant digital actors
- We are subject to other business and cultural trends
- Continually building on ‘rented land’
- Can learn from, but can’t bet on capturing good ideas
