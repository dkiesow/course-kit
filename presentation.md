# Journalist’s Creed

I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust 

I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.  

I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.

# Feedback Loops

![Image](/assets/cause_effect.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- **Clear:** Obvious solutions, possibly with a single agreed upon best-practice documented in a rulebook.
- **Complicated:** Known solutions that may cross domains of expertise or where cause-and-effect is difficult to track. May require the analysis and integration of multiple rulebooks.
- **Complex:** Lacks broadly applicable best practices or recipes. The system may involve novel elements and cause/effect are only indirectly related.
- **Chaotic:** A dynamically changing complex system that may reject previously viable solutions.

# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- **Simple:** Baking a cake with a recipe from a cookbook.
- **Complicated:** Cooking a full four-course meal for your family who expect to eat at 7:00 p.m.
- **Complex:** Cooking for 100 people arriving throughout the evening who are allowed special off-menu requests that may include dishes you may lack ingredients for.
- **Chaotic:** Cooking meals for the same 100 people who are also allowed to change their order at anytime during the process and where the gas and electricity frequently turn off at unexpected times.


---

<!-- _class: gold-bullets -->
# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- It is the nature of emergent problems to be complicated or complex
- The lack of visible connection between cause and effect (no feedback loop) diminishes our ability to learn and improve the process.
- Complex problems can become ‘complicated’ or even ‘simple’ over time as solutions and best practices are identified and tested
- Chaotic environments may not necessarily be improved through effort/learning. Re-defining the scope of the problem may be the better solution.

A newspaper wants to launch a subscription service / paywall

# A broken fan

- You are staying for a few days in a friend’s apartment in a brand new building
- Your friend is out and you have turned on the fan to cool the room
- Ten minutes later the fan turns off - you turn it back on
- Five minutes later it turns off again - and so on, several times

# Problem Domains

- User Error
- Mechanical failure
- Power supply
- Accidental cause
- Other actor
- External systems


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The root cause

- The building is new
- Every apartment has the same brand / model ceiling fan
- They have a remote control
- Each remote carries one of eight different ID codes to connect to a specific fan
- The remotes in this building can reach 16 different apartments


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Five Whys

- ISSUE: The fan keeps turning off
- Why: The remote controls reach other apartments
- Why: The RF strength is too high
- (And) Why: The remotes have overlapping ID codes
- (And) Why: Only eight codes are programmed
- Why: The design of the fans assumed single-family homes, not apartments
- (Also) Why: The developer of the apartments did not read the fine print

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The invention of consumerism

- Industrialization of the U.S. reduced costs and increased volume
- Railroads drove mass distribution
- Mass distribution increased competition
- Competition incentivized diversification
- Diversification required marketing and promotion to differentiate


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The business of business

- Diversification and distribution required specialization
- Managing specialization and scale led to organizational restructuring
- Restructuring required re-allocation of previously shared functions
- Functional - One Design department across brands
- Divisional - Each brand with its own Design team
- Matrix - Each brand has dedicated Designers from a centralized team


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->

- Flat - small organizations
- Functional - shared resources across products / divisions
- Divisional - resources work within a division

# Control vs Agility

![Image](/assets/control_agility.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# What works best?

WHY do many businesses land on a Hybrid model?

- **Centralization and Control** work best in stable, mature markets
- And, in businesses with a single product and market
- **Decentralization and Agility** are better suited to new and chaotic markets
- Or, in businesses with diversified products and markets


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Hybrid

- Some functions (Accounting) should not be innovating
- Other functions (Human Resources) may be centralized with some minimal risk
- Depending on the core consumer value of the business - functions that differentiate (Design, Marketing) might be best de-centralized/kept very local.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Why an audience focus?

Why does decentralization / optimization often win?

- In a competitive environment - products must differentiate
- Quickest way is to understand and serve consumer needs
- Business must allow workers closest to customers (who have empathy / understanding of needs) to drive change
- Organizational Structure must balance decentralization and efficiency

# Start by discovering consumer needs

People are complicated and multitasking. They don’t always recognize or can’t always explain needs and possible solutions.


- We need to understand how people think and why
- We must use appropriate research methods
- Then, synthesize the data and develop insights


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Discovering consumer needs

- Our brains don’t work the way we think they do
- We don’t make decisions rationally

# Bounded rationality (page 31)

- We do NOT make decisions based on perfect information, focused attention and flawless judgement. *(Optimizing)*
- Traditional economic theory assumes we do.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Bounded rationality

- Our decisions are made with limited information, are based heavily on past experiences and are made in a rush. We try to balance the effort of the decision against the costs and benefits of the choice. *(Satisficing)*
- We call this reliance on patterns a heuristic - or an informed guess.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# Don’t make me think

- Satisficing vs Optimizing
- Our brains have limited processing power
- Working (transient) memory is required to learn new things
- If overloaded, frustration and task failure results
- Solutions must minimize load

> "To fix the creaking at the Post, Lewis invokes a couple of tropes from 2012 and 2024, respectively: The company will achieve “scale” by “embracing AI in a much more effective way.” Fair—but almost everyone in the news business is going after some combination of scale and AI (some by letting robots flat-out make stuff up), and odds are it will work for very few. Maybe the Post will be one. I’m rooting for them. But what about the journalism that all of us need to keep democracy alive? What is—to use a word smart men love to toss out—the gamechanger for the news business?”

# Understanding consumers

**Day One**
Researcher stood inside the restaurant and took an inventory of all milkshake-buying customers. This is a very simple ethnographic-like study.

- 40% of shakes were sold between 6a - 8a.
- Most purchasers arrived alone
- Bought only a shake
- Left with their drink

Do you come to this restaurant often?
**Sometimes.**

**Better Day Two Questions**

Did you buy a milkshake yesterday?
**No**
What did you buy?
**A bagel; a doughnut; a banana…**
Today, why did you buy a milkshake instead?


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Understanding Jobs to Be Done

On days they did not buy a milkshake, they were filling the same need with other products. (Other foods in this case.)

The consumers were HIRING the milkshake for a specific job.

If we understand the job, we understand their needs and motivations better.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Understanding Jobs to Be Done

**The job in this case:**

These were commuters with a 20 - 30 minute drive to work

They were bored but also hungry
- A banana is eaten too quickly
- It is difficult to put cream cheese on a bagel while driving
- The doughnut is not filling 

The milkshake takes 20 minutes to drink, can be done with one hand and keeps them full until lunch.
