# Journalist’s Creed

I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust 

I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.  

I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.

# The Mission of News

- Help a community to understand itself
- Inform discussions and decisions that favor a healthy civic life
- Enabled by a wall between business and editorial
- But, the digital economy knocks down the wall

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Public Goods / Information Goods

- Easily accessible, reproducible, shareable without payment
- Digital also allows sharing beyond the original platform
- Challenges to subscriptions but also advertising

> “BIDDEFORD, Maine—The mayor worries for his city because the local newspaper, the Journal Tribune, ended its 135-year run Saturday. The superintendent of the schools isn’t sure how he will tell the community what’s happening inside its classrooms. The head of the local food pantry is in mourning; he turned to the paper when his organization was about to be kicked out of its building.
The three city leaders are distressed. That said, none of them was subscribing to the paper when it published its last issue.”

> “A wealth of information means a dearth of something else; a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes (which is) the attention of its recipients. A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.”

# Innovation theory Preview

Theories of Innovation

- News has always been innovative
- Good ideas don’t always succeed
- Pro-Innovation bias is a risk
- Cost of failure in news is paid by communities


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# To understand technology / innovation

- We need to understand its history
- Who created it?
- Why?
- For whom?
- What is it good for?
- What are its harms?
- Why did/didn’t it succeed?

# Big Tech is Scale

- Platforms commodify a global audience
- **…and disintermediate local publishers**
- Hold a duopoly over digital advertising
- Control a firehose of traffic
- Face little/no (U.S.) regulation
- Chase profit, not the public interest
- Are increasingly controlled by chaos monkeys

> Most problems worth solving require us to cross boundaries within the organization, across diverse expertise, different understandings, and sometimes conflicting goals and incentives.

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# It asks how journalism can:

- Serve our communities better
- Build sustainable organizations
- Build healthy organizations


---

<!-- _class: gold-bullets -->
# News needs journalists who…

- Understand the business
- Understand audience needs
- Can uphold editorial values and ethics
- Can lead

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Community Doesn’t Scale

- Programmatic advertising needs scale
- Local journalism has specific geographic constraints
- Chasing a scaled business model but a local editorial mission is a fundamental conflict
- Local journalism requires a local community engaged at all levels

# Dunbar

“National and local journalism are not the same business. The New York Times can chase scale for profit, The Centre Daily Times can’t. Because what the New York Times has is an audience. In State College, they have a community.”

> Most Americans (69%) say that if their local newspaper no longer existed, it would not have a major impact on their ability to keep up with information and news about their community. Yet the data show that newspapers play a much bigger role in people’s lives than many may realize. Newspapers (both the print and online versions, though primarily print) rank first or tie for first as the source people rely on most for 11 of the 16 different kinds of local information asked about—more topics than any other media source.

- Global connectivity but local fragmentation
- A shift of power to platforms (and centralization of power and profit)
- The acceleration of change (move fast, break things)
- Datafication of society
- --Loss of Privacy
