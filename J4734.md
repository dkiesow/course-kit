# Journalist’s Creed

I believe that the public journal is a public trust; that all connected with it are, to the full measure of their responsibility, trustees for the public; that acceptance of a lesser service than the public service is betrayal of this trust 

I believe that clear thinking and clear statement, accuracy and fairness are fundamental to good journalism.  

I believe that advertising, news and editorial columns should alike serve the best interests of readers; that a single standard of helpful truth and cleanness should prevail for all; that the supreme test of good journalism is the measure of its public service.

# Feedback Loops

![Image](/assets/cause_effect.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- **Clear:** Obvious solutions, possibly with a single agreed upon best-practice documented in a rulebook.
- **Complicated:** Known solutions that may cross domains of expertise or where cause-and-effect is difficult to track. May require the analysis and integration of multiple rulebooks.
- **Complex:** Lacks broadly applicable best practices or recipes. The system may involve novel elements and cause/effect are only indirectly related.
- **Chaotic:** A dynamically changing complex system that may reject previously viable solutions.

# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- **Simple:** Baking a cake with a recipe from a cookbook.
- **Complicated:** Cooking a full four-course meal for your family who expect to eat at 7:00 p.m.
- **Complex:** Cooking for 100 people arriving throughout the evening who are allowed special off-menu requests that may include dishes you may lack ingredients for.
- **Chaotic:** Cooking meals for the same 100 people who are also allowed to change their order at anytime during the process and where the gas and electricity frequently turn off at unexpected times.


---

<!-- _class: gold-bullets -->
# Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic

- It is the nature of emergent problems to be complicated or complex
- The lack of visible connection between cause and effect (no feedback loop) diminishes our ability to learn and improve the process.
- Complex problems can become ‘complicated’ or even ‘simple’ over time as solutions and best practices are identified and tested
- Chaotic environments may not necessarily be improved through effort/learning. Re-defining the scope of the problem may be the better solution.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# For example

It is the first day of school, you are living in a new apartment off-campus, and you need to get to class on time.

- Is this problem simple, complicated, complex or chaotic?
- What are the elements of the problem?
- Which elements can we control / manage?
- How do we go about simplifying it?
- How do we solve for it?


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Problem Solving

Analyze the problem

- Do I have a car?
- Where do I park?
- How far from campus?
- Does my complex have a bus?
- When does it run?
- Is it normally dependable?
- Even on the first day of school?

# A broken fan

- You are staying for a few days in a friend’s apartment in a brand new building
- Your friend is out and you have turned on the fan to cool the room
- Ten minutes later the fan turns off - you turn it back on
- Five minutes later it turns off again - and so on, several times


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Problem Domains

- User Error
- Mechanical failure
- Power supply
- Accidental cause
- Other actor
- External systems


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The root cause

- The building is new
- Every apartment has the same brand / model ceiling fan
- They have a remote control
- Each remote carries one of eight different ID codes to connect to a specific fan
- The remotes in this building can reach 16 different apartments


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Five Whys

- ISSUE: The fan keeps turning off
- Why: The remote controls reach other apartments
- Why: The RF strength is too high
- (And) Why: The remotes have overlapping ID codes
- (And) Why: Only eight codes are programmed
- Why: The design of the fans assumed single-family homes, not apartments
- (Also) Why: The developer of the apartments did not read the fine print

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The invention of consumerism

- Industrialization of the U.S. reduced costs and increased volume
- Railroads drove mass distribution
- Mass distribution increased competition
- Competition incentivized diversification
- Diversification required marketing and promotion to differentiate


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# The business of business

- Diversification and distribution required specialization
- Managing specialization and scale led to organizational restructuring
- Restructuring required re-allocation of previously shared functions
- Functional - One Design department across brands
- Divisional - Each brand with its own Design team
- Matrix - Each brand has dedicated Designers from a centralized team


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->

<!-- _class: gold-bullets -->
# Why Soap?

- Decentralization of work and control
- Local capacity and expertise
- Easier cordination of work
- Improved information sharing and alignment

# Control vs Agility

![Image](/assets/control_agility.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# What works best?

WHY do many businesses land on a Hybrid model?

- **Centralization and Control** work best in stable, mature markets
- And, in businesses with a single product and market
- **Decentralization and Agility** are better suited to new and chaotic markets
- Or, in businesses with diversified products and markets


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Hybrid

- Some functions (Accounting) should not be innovating
- Other functions (Human Resources) may be centralized with some minimal risk
- Depending on the core consumer value of the business - functions that differentiate (Design, Marketing) might be best de-centralized/kept very local.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Why an audience focus?

Why does decentralization / optimization often win?

- In a competitive environment - products must differentiate
- Quickest way is to understand and serve consumer needs
- Business must allow workers closest to customers (who have empathy / understanding of needs) to drive change
- Organizational Structure must balance decentralization and efficiency

# Start by discovering consumer needs

People are complicated and multitasking. They don’t always recognize or can’t always explain needs and possible solutions.

- We must use appropriate research methods
- Then, synthesize the data and develop insights


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Discovering consumer needs

- Our brains don’t work the way we think they do

# Bounded rationality (page 31)

- We do NOT make decisions based on perfect information, focused attention and flawless judgement. *(Optimizing)*
- Traditional economic theory assumes we do.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Bounded rationality

- Our decisions are made with limited information, are based heavily on past experiences and are made in a rush. We try to balance the effort of the decision against the costs and benefits of the choice. *(Satisficing)*
- We call this reliance on patterns a heuristic - or an informed guess.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# Don’t make me think

- Satisficing vs Optimizing
- Our brains have limited processing power
- Working (transient) memory is required to learn new things
- If overloaded, frustration and task failure results
- Solutions must minimize load

> "To fix the creaking at the Post, Lewis invokes a couple of tropes from 2012 and 2024, respectively: The company will achieve “scale” by “embracing AI in a much more effective way.” Fair—but almost everyone in the news business is going after some combination of scale and AI (some by letting robots flat-out make stuff up), and odds are it will work for very few. Maybe the Post will be one. I’m rooting for them. But what about the journalism that all of us need to keep democracy alive? What is—to use a word smart men love to toss out—the gamechanger for the news business?”

These were commuters with a 20 - 30 minute drive to work

They were bored but also hungry
- A banana is eaten too quickly
- It is difficult to put cream cheese on a bagel while driving
- The doughnut is not filling 

The milkshake takes 20 minutes to drink, can be done with one hand and keeps them full until lunch.

# Economics of news

- *Information good* - digital and can be reproduced and shared at no cost
- *Experience good* - the value can not be evaluated until after use
- *Public Good* - Non rivalrous and non excludable

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Public Goods

The good is (can be) shared equally, and your use of it does not decrease the inventory.

- Clean Air
- Street Lighting
- Fourth of July Fireworks
- National Defense

# News is an Information Good

A product or service that can be digitized, copied, shared, and delivered digitally.

- A form of 'experience good'
- We will talk more about it later


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Information drives decisions

Digitization transforms the workplace - much like it has transformed the business of news

- Adapting to market demands
- Organizing operations to deliver products and services
- Reducing uncertainty and risk in that process

> “One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.”

# Innovation is received as:

- Determinism - the idea that **technology shapes society and drives social change**, rather than the other way around. It assumes that once a technology exists, its development and effects are **inevitable** and largely **out of human control.**
- Social Constructivism - Technology does not determine society; instead, society determines how technology develops and is used. **Different social groups** (engineers, users, regulators, companies) can **have different interpretations** of what a technology is for. Technologies evolve to satisfy social, cultural, economic, or political needs, not just technical ones.


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Innovation is studied:

- **Science and Technology Studies** - How science, technology, and society shape each other
- **Social Construction of Technology** - Technologies evolve based on the needs, interpretations, and struggles of different social groups.
- **Actor Network Theory** - Humans and tech (actors) collaborate to shape outcomes

# What problem was it solving for, and for who?

- *Wealthy young men / “athletic class”:* Core users; it required balance, daring, and strength, so it became a badge of masculinity and sporting prowess.
- *Clubs and sporting associations*: Promoted races, tours, and elite social networks around cycling.
- *Manufacturers*: Catered to upper-class market; expensive to produce, profitable as luxury goods.
- *Excluded groups* (working class, women, older riders): Shut  out by high cost and danger — their dissatisfaction created  pressure for safer designs.

- *Reform-minded inventors & engineers:* Wanted to democratize cycling by making it safer (chain drive, lower seat height).
- *Potential new riders* (women, middle class, older men): Attracted by the idea of safe cycling, but Lawson’s version was heavy and awkward, so uptake was limited.
- *Traditionalists* (penny-farthing riders): Rejected it as ungainly and unmanly compared to the daring “ordinary.”
- *Manufacturers*: Initially hesitant to invest heavily since market  demand was uncertain.

# Innovation is seen through Hindsight Bias

- A cognitive bias where people perceive events as having been more predictable after they have already happened than they actually were beforehand.

> “BIDDEFORD, Maine—The mayor worries for his city because the local newspaper, the Journal Tribune, ended its 135-year run Saturday. The superintendent of the schools isn’t sure how he will tell the community what’s happening inside its classrooms. The head of the local food pantry is in mourning; he turned to the paper when his organization was about to be kicked out of its building.
The three city leaders are distressed. That said, none of them was subscribing to the paper when it published its last issue.”

# Digital advertising

- Google, Facebook and Amazon control 64% in the U.S.
- The Guardian - 70% of digital ad spend is diverted from publishers
- Commodifies audience, disintermediates publishers

# Target(ed) advertising

- Target (and all retailers) utilize data to track and predict shopping behaviors
- Analysis reveled women change their shopping habits early in pregnancy
- Marketing at the inflection point of ‘new needs’

# It's not working

- The Guardian found 70% of ad revenue is lost in the system
- Google and Meta both buy, sell and measure ad performance
- System is opaque and unaccountable
- Even when it works, it only works at scale

> "We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate... We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.”

# Community Doesn’t Scale

- Programmatic advertising needs scale
- Local journalism has specific geographic constraints
- Chasing a scaled business model but a local editorial mission is a fundamental conflict
- Local journalism requires a local community engaged at all levels


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# The Consequences of Scale

- Average page-load times are far too high
- Ad takeovers and abusive redirects drive daily complaints
- Click-bait, attention-gap headlines, promoted links…
- Opportunity cost spent on platform plays
- Pushing out-of-state stories over social to go viral
- A focus on page views as the key metric

# Attention Economy

Newspapers and broadcasters had a monopoly on news & information
In the U.S. - you got the morning newspaper and watched the 6 p.m. TV news
Cable TV, then the Internet ended that monopoly

# Change in Digital News

- Culture, tech and embedded processes make change difficult in legacy organizations
- But the disruption of audience and business models require it
- We must focus our concerns on audience needs
- But we must also change our organizations
- Both require intangible changes - and also new goals, tools & incentives

# Change is hard

The digital economy imposes new tools and skills on journalism and forces us to negotiate independent problems at every level.

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Final Paper Outline: Five Paragraphs - Due: March 6 

**PARAGRAPH THREE**
 Whether you believe your topic/focus is or isn't the 'future' of news, provide a few sentences discussing the benefits, risks, incentives or constraints of the idea. What makes it practical, impractical, beneficial, or harmful to news. Include examples of the risks/benefits when possible.  
**PARAGRAPH FOUR**
A few final sentences about where this idea is headed within news - what is the current trajectory and what do you think it should be?
**CONCLUSION**
Summarize your main points - restate the thesis and connect it with the body of the essay.  (You may need to rework/revise your paragraphs at this point to make the conclusion coherent. That is the objective.)

# Digital Changes Things

- Information abundance (and attention scarcity)
- End of gatekeeping (and of those institutions)
- Global connectivity but local fragmentation
- A shift of power to platforms (and centralization of power and profit)
- The acceleration of change (move fast, break things)
- Datafication of society
- --Loss of Privacy

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Digital Changes Things

Journalism needs to adapt - but maintain its focus on mission and community

- Develop capacity for digital strategy
- Integrate technology and technologists
- Recognize the competitive threat of *everything else* online
- Find and engage audiences - with news not distraction
- We broadly call these methods: news product thinking


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Finding a Product-Market Fit

Aligning a product or service with the needs of a clearly defined group. It is demonstrated when consumers:


- Adopt it
- Have a high retention rate
- Use it regularly
- Recommend it to others

<!-- _class: template-bullets-image -->
# Finding a Product-Market Fit

New restaurant in town: One Thing

**Who is this restaurant serving?**


- No menu - flat-rate price.
- It serves one different meal daily for lunch
- Each meal is $10 - cash only
- Located near campus

![Image](/assets/one_thing.png)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Finding a Product-Market Fit

A constraint (one dish or one price) is a design choice. The questions are:

- Was the choice intentional or unintentional? (how do we know?)
- What group / audience will find it relevant/useful? (how do we know?)
- Is it working? (how do we know?)
- To succeed or grow, what must we do next? (how do we know?)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Who is news designed for?

- Does everyone care about CoMo news? (geography)
- Can everyone afford a subscription? (price)
- Do we cover everyone in our reporting? (menu)
- Does everyone have broadband (accessibility)
- What operational trade-offs have we made? (sustainability)


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# Desgning the news

Implicitly, we have NEVER been equally serving 'everyone' but the industrial model and profitability obscured that reality. We must now approach the discussion with more intentionality and scientific rigor. Not all of our constraints are weaknesses - some are by design. But which are which?

- Limited geography
- Limited coverage topics
- Cost of access
- Relevance / perceived value
- Bias / gaps
- The demands of organizational structure and profits

# Innovating the News

- Discussing this chapter Week 7 & 8
- Journalism has a long history of embracing innovation
- And, it has also been slow to adapt to the digital age
- We must develop community-focused solutions’
- Newsrooms are, unevenly, becoming more digital


---

<!-- _class: template-quote -->
> Innovation is:
The creation of new social or economic value


---

<!-- _class: template-bullets -->
# But really also…

- An idea new to us
- A process improvement that boosts value
- A new business model
- An old product brought to a new market
- A novel combination of the above
